          <h3 className="rw__legal__title">1. Introduction</h3>
          <div className="rw__legal__text">
            <p>
              These Terms & Conditions (the “Terms”) are issued by Tempus Labs Inc., a limited company based in the
              British Virgin Islands (the “Issuer”) in association with Tempus Foundation Company, a foundation company
              based in the Cayman Islands (the “Foundation”) (the Issuer and the Foundation together, “Raft”, “we”,
              “our”, or “us”). We own and operate the frontend <Link to="/">app.raft.fi</Link>, which acts as an
              independently deployed and maintained instance of the Raft protocol (the website and any applications
              together, the “Frontend”). These Terms explain the terms and conditions on which you may use and access
              the Frontend. These Terms apply to you as a user of the Frontend (for the avoidance of doubt, this
              includes all apps, products, services, tools, and information made available on the Frontend).
            </p>
            <p>
              Please read these Terms carefully as they explain the terms and conditions on which you may use and access
              the Frontend. In particular, paragraph 7 of the Terms contains important eligibility requirements on who
              may access and use the Frontend. If you do not meet and/or are unable to comply with these eligibility
              requirements, you are not authorised to use (and must immediately stop accessing and using) the Frontend.
              Paragraphs 19 to 21 of the Terms also include provisions which impact your rights as to how disputes are
              resolved, including a binding mandatory arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision.
            </p>
            <p>
              By accessing or using the Frontend, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by
              the Terms in their entirety. If you do not agree with the Terms, you are not authorised to use (and must
              immediately stop accessing and using) the Frontend.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="rw__legal__title">2. Modification of the Terms</h3>
          <div className="rw__legal__text">
            <p>
              We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify these Terms at any time. If we make any
              modifications, we will update the date at the top of these Terms. All changes will be immediately
              effective. You should check these Terms periodically to familiarise yourself with any changes. Your
              continued access or use of the Frontend will serve as confirmation of your acceptance of the changes. If
              you do not agree with any modification to these Terms, you must immediately stop accessing and using the
              Frontend.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="rw__legal__title">3. Transactions carried out on the Frontend</h3>
          <div className="rw__legal__text">
            <p>
              As part of the Frontend, we provide access to crypto applications on the blockchain (which includes any
              blockchain that crypto applications hosted on the Frontend are deployed on, including but not limited to
              Ethereum). These crypto applications allow users to use certain cryptoassets and interact with smart
              contracts deployed on the blockchain (“Smart Contracts'').
            </p>
            <p>
              You may be required to pay a fee (including but not limited to gas costs) to perform a
              transaction/interact with a Smart Contract on the Frontend. You acknowledge and agree that we have no
              control over any transactions or interactions made on the Frontend, the method of payment or interaction,
              or any actual payments of transactions. Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of
              the applicable cryptocurrency tokens stored in your compatible wallet address to complete any transaction
              or interaction before initiating any such transaction or interaction.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="rw__legal__title">4. Access to the Frontend</h3>
          <div className="rw__legal__text">
            <p>
              Access to the Frontend is provided “as is” and on an “as available” basis only. To the fullest extent
              permitted by law, we disclaim any representations and warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or
              statutory, including (but not limited to) the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
              purpose. You understand and agree that your use of the Frontend is at your own risk. A non-exhaustive list
              of risks of using the Frontend can be found in paragraph 6 below.
            </p>

            <p>
              We do not guarantee that the Frontend, or any content on it, will always be available, uninterrupted,
              timely, or secure, or free from errors, omissions, defects, viruses, or other harmful elements. You are
              responsible for configuring your information technology, computer programmes, and platform in order to
              access the Frontend. You should use your own virus protection software.
            </p>

            <p>
              We cannot promise that the use of the Frontend, or any content taken from the Frontend, will not infringe
              the rights of any third party.
            </p>

            <p>
              From time to time, access to the Frontend may be interrupted, suspended or restricted (temporarily or
              permanently), in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, including because of a fault, error, or
              unforeseen circumstances (including circumstances or events beyond our control, including without
              limitation any flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war,
              insurrection, riot, labour dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or
              equipment or software malfunction), or because we are carrying out planned maintenance.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="rw__legal__title">5. All rights reserved</h3>
          <div className="rw__legal__text">
            <p>
              We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Frontend to any person (including imposing age
              restrictions), geographic area, or jurisdiction we so desire and/or to terminate your access to and use of
              the Frontend, at any time and in our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may also suspend or disable your access to the Frontend if we consider it reasonable to do so, e.g. if
              you breach these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to modify, substitute, eliminate, or add to the content of the Frontend at any time.
              Additionally, some of the content may be out of date at any given time and we are under no obligation to
              update it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will not be liable to you for any loss or damage you may suffer as a result of the Frontend being
              unavailable at any time for any reason.
            </p>

            <p>
              We may cooperate with any law enforcement, court or government investigation or order or third party
              requesting or directing that we disclose information or content or information that you provide on the
              Frontend.

          <h3 className="rw__legal__title">6. Risks of using the Frontend</h3>
          <div className="rw__legal__text">
            <p>
              You understand and agree that the Frontend and your use of the Frontend involves certain risks, involving
              without limitation the following risks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                That any Smart Contracts you interact with are entirely your own responsibility and liability, and that
                we are not party to the Smart Contracts.
              </li>
              <li>
                At any time, access to your cryptoassets may be suspended, terminated, or there may be a delay in your
                access to or use of your cryptoassets, which may result in the cryptoassets diminishing in value or you
                being unable to complete a transaction or interaction in respect of a Smart Contract.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Frontend may be suspended or terminated for any or no reason, which may limit your access to your
                cryptoassets.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Frontend could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, which would impede or
                limit our ability to continue to make available (and so impede or limit your ability to access or use)
                the Frontend.
              </li>
              <li>
                You understand that blockchain technology remains under development, which creates technological and
                security risks when using the Frontend in addition to uncertainty relating to cryptoassets and
                blockchain transactions therein.
              </li>
              <li>
                The cost of transacting on the blockchain is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any
                activities taking place on the blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs
                when using the Frontend.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Frontend may be subject to flaws. You are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the
                Frontend. This warning and others we provide in these Terms in no way represents an ongoing duty on us
                to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilising or accessing the Frontend.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking and other technical advancements,
                such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to the Frontend, and could result
                in the theft or loss of your cryptoassets.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Accordingly, you expressly agree that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You assume all risk in connection with your access and use of the Frontend, the crypto applications, and
                the Smart Contracts.
              </li>
              <li>
                You alone are responsible for securing the private key(s) associated with your cryptoassets. You
                understand that we do not have access to your private key(s) and that losing control of your private
                key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to cryptoassets. Neither we nor any other
                person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your cryptoassets. If your private key(s) are lost,
                then you will not be able to transfer your cryptoassets to any other blockchain address or wallet. If
                this occurs, then you will not be able to realise any value or utility from the cryptoassets that you
                may hold.
              </li>
              <li>
                You expressly waive and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages
                arising from or in any way related to your use of the Frontend, the crypto applications, or the Smart
                Contracts.
              </li>
            </ul>

                avoidance of doubt, we make no representation that the Frontend is appropriate or available for use in
                any particular jurisdiction. Users who access or use the Frontend do so at their own risk and are
                entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations in their
                jurisdiction.

              that you interact with. We do not collect any personal information from you (e.g., your name or other
              identifiers that can be linked to you). We may, however, use third party service providers, which may
              receive or independently obtain your personal information from publicly available sources. We do not
              control how these third parties handle your data and you should review their privacy policies to
              understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information. By accessing and using the
              Frontend, you understand and consent to our data practices and how any service providers we use may treat
              your information.
            </p>

              The Frontend (including the applications) is purely non-custodial, meaning you are solely responsible for
              the custody of the cryptographic private keys to the cryptoasset wallets you hold. These Terms are not
              intended to, and do not create or impose, any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by

              Any use or interaction with the Frontend requires a certain level of financial and technical
              sophistication to understand the inherent risks, including those listed in these Terms. By accessing and
              using the Frontend, you represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to
              understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that
              you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets and tokens. In particular, you
              understand that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible.
            </p>
            <p>
              You further understand that the markets for these digital assets are highly volatile due to factors
              including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You
              acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based
              systems are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further understand and accept the risk
              that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to the Frontend, you
              may suffer loss due to price fluctuations, and experience significant price slippage and cost.
            </p>

              You further understand that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and cannot be held
              liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Frontend.
            </p>
            <p>

              period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability, or (b) USD $100, whichever
              is greater. This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on
              contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been advised of the
              possibility of such liability. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
              limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and
              limitations set forth in these Terms may not apply to you. This limitation of liability shall apply to the

              individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective
              action, or other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and unless we agree
              otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering
